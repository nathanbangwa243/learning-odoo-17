## Chap 1 : Architecture Overview

In the world of software, there exists a system known as Odoo, which follows a multitier structure. It resembles a grand castle with three distinct layers: the presentation tier, the logic tier, and the data tier. 🏰

![Texte alternatif](docs/images/architechture.png)

In this castle, the presentation tier is like the castle's exterior, made of HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS. It's what visitors see and interact with. The logic tier, however, is like the castle's intricate machinery, all written in Python. This layer handles the castle's inner workings, ensuring everything runs smoothly. Lastly, the data tier, akin to the castle's vault, stores all the important information using PostgreSQL as its guardian. 🛡️

Now, within this castle, developers roam freely, crafting extensions called modules. Each module is like a special chamber dedicated to a specific purpose. Some modules add new features to the castle, while others extend existing functionalities. Imagine one module adding magical accounting rules to manage the kingdom's finances, while another conjures up real-time visualizations of flying dragons. 🐉

To understand these modules, one has to learn the castle's language. A module can contain various elements like business objects, object views, data files, web controllers, and even static web data like images and scripts. Each element serves a unique purpose, contributing to the castle's grandeur. 🌟

Imagine a brave adventurer embarking on a journey to create their own module. They venture into the module's directory, organized neatly like rooms in a castle. Inside, they find business objects, declared as Python classes, object views defining how information is displayed, and data files, either XML or CSV, holding vital information for the castle's operation. 🛠️

But wait, there are different versions of this castle! Odoo comes in two flavors: Enterprise and Community. The Enterprise version, with its licensed access, offers extra features, like secret chambers hidden within the castle walls. However, from a technical standpoint, these extra features are just additional modules layered atop the Community version. 🔒

Now, our adventurer is ready to embark on their journey. But before diving into writing code, they decide to prepare by reviewing the castle's installation process. After all, even seasoned knights need to ensure they start their quests on the right foot. 🚀

And thus, armed with knowledge and determination, our adventurer sets forth to conquer the realm of Odoo, one module at a time. 🌌

## Chapter 2: Development Environment Configuration


### Note:
> `./addons` : This directory contains all the modules we want to add to Odoo 17. Therefore, it includes the module we are going to develop.

> This directory will be part of the addon paths that reference all directories containing Odoo modules.
> 
> 
> `./config/odoo.conf` : This file contains Odoo configurations.
>
> `docker-compose.yml` : This file contains deployment configurations for deploying Odoo on localhost.

🌐 In the world of Odoo, where developers shape the digital corridors of the software, setting up the development environment is a key step. Like a chef preparing their favorite recipe, each developer has their own method, but for Odoo insiders, there's a preferred path: installation from the source code.

It all starts with environment preparation. Just like preparing ingredients to concoct a delightful dish, following the steps of the contribution guide is essential. Once these steps are followed, you have two precious ingredients: the local repositories [odoo/odoo](https://github.com/odoo/odoo) and [odoo/enterprise](https://github.com/odoo/enterprise).

For easier installation, it's better to use the [containerized version of Odoo](https://hub.docker.com/_/odoo/) and then orchestrate with Docker. Take a look at the `./docker-compose.yml` file.

To complete the preparation, you need to copy this project to your personal GitHub account. Click `"Fork"` to create a copy of this repository in your account.

Then, using the command below, replace `<your_github_account>` with the name of your GitHub account to download your copy of this project to your machine:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:<votre_compte_github>/learning-odoo-17.git
```

And there you go! Your environment is ready to run Odoo on your local machine. And here's how to launch Odoo 17 on your machine:

```bash
cd learning-odoo-17
docker compose up -d
```
To check the installation, simply open your browser and type [http://localhost:8069/web](http://localhost:8069/web).

```yaml
username : admin
password : admin
```

To view the `logs` data of the `odoo` container:

```bash
docker logs -f odoo17Learning
docker logs -f postgres_odoo17Learning
```

Now that your server is running, it's time to write our own application! 😎

## Chapter 3 : A New Application.

📖 The purpose of this chapter is to embark on a journey of creation, laying the very foundation for a brand new `Odoo module`. Imagine starting from scratch, with only the bare essentials needed to catch Odoo's attention. As we progress through the chapters, we'll add layers of features, weaving a tapestry of a realistic business case.

🏠 Welcome to the realm of the `Real Estate` Advertisement module. This module delves into a specialized business area not commonly found in the standard set of Odoo modules: `real estate`. But before diving headfirst into development, it's wise to scout Odoo's vast kingdom to ensure no existing solutions already address our specific needs.

🔍 Picture a main `list view` adorned with various advertisements, each telling a story of properties waiting to be discovered. The form view reveals essential details about each property: from the number of bedrooms to the presence of a garden, offering a glimpse into the world within.

![App Overview Capture](docs/images/app-overview.png)

💼 The second tab unveils a treasure trove of `offers`, where potential `buyers` can make `bids` above or below the expected `selling price`. It's a realm where `negotiations` unfold, leaving the final decision in the hands of the `seller`.

![App Overview Offers Capture](docs/images/app-overview-offers.png)

🎥 And as if by magic, a quick video showcases the graceful dance of the module's workflow. Ah, if only it were captured already!

🛠 But fret not, for our journey begins with a humble task: preparing the `addon directory`. This step ensures that Odoo recognizes our newborn module, even if it's but an empty vessel for now. Soon, it will proudly stand among the `Apps`, awaiting its chance to shine.

✨ With a flick of a wand (or perhaps a few keyboard strokes), we create the necessary files: `__init__.py` and `__manifest__.py`. These files breathe life into our module, defining its `name` and `dependencies`, much like a spellbook detailing the ingredients of a potent potion.

🧙‍♂️ `Restart` the Odoo server, `update` the Apps list, and behold! Our module, like a budding flower, blooms into view. But wait, did it not appear? Fear not, for a simple tweak, removing the `default filter`, reveals our creation in all its glory.

🔑 And now, with a final flourish, `we make our module an 'App'`, ensuring its presence even when the `Apps filter` is on. Though it may be but an empty shell, devoid of menus, it's a promising start to our magical journey.

📜 With the groundwork laid, our adventure continues as we prepare to `create our first model`. Exciting times lie ahead as we breathe life into our module, one enchanting step at a time.

## Chapter 4 : Models And Basic Fields

🏰 Picture our `Odoo module` as a freshly built house - sturdy and promising, yet lacking the warmth of life within its walls. In this chapter, our quest was to breathe life into our module by giving it the ability to `store data`. 💼

As we delved deeper into the documentation, we discovered [Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)](https://www.prisma.io/dataguide/types/relational/what-is-an-orm), a wondrous tool bridging the gap between our Python code and the `database`. ✨ This powerful technique allows us to define our `business objects as Python classes`, extending the `Model` class. With a simple invocation, our model came to life, seamlessly integrating into Odoo's automated persistence system.

Our task was to create the `real estate properties model`. Inspired by the example given in the `CRM module`, we embarked on our quest, shaping the necessary files and folders to define our `model`. 🏡 With each keystroke, the framework began to take shape, and soon, our model stood proudly, ready to capture the essence of `real estate properties`.

But our journey did not end there. We set out to infuse our model with `basic fields`, such as `name`, `description`, and `price`. Like an artisan adding details to a work of art, we enriched our model with `fields` of different `types` - `Char`, `Text`, `Integer`, and even `Boolean`. Each field brought a new dimension to our `model`, enriching it with the essence of real-world data. 🎨

💡 Here's how to connect to the database inside the container to view the data.

```bash
docker exec -it postgres_odoo17Learning psql -U admin -d learning_db

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM estate_property;

\d estate_property;
```

![Postgres EstateProperty Model Capture](docs/images/app-postgres-estate-property.png)

Yet, our work was not complete until we ensured the `integrity` of our `data`. With a flourish of our craftsmanship, we defined `attributes` for our `fields`, making them `required` and ensuring their presence in every `record`. We even explored the realm of `Automatic Fields`, uncovering the hidden mechanism behind fields like `id`, `create_date`, and `write_user`. 🔮

And so, our journey through Chapter 4 came to an end, but our module was now imbued with the power to `store and manage` real estate `data`. With each step forward, our `module` grew stronger, paving the way for greater adventures in the realm of `Odoo`. 🚀
